        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Business ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Emmanuel Thomas Gonzalez and I am currently enrolled at the University of California, Riverside. As of Fall of 2021, I am a Pre-Business student and my academic goal is to enroll into the School of Business at UCR. As of now, I am interested in the fields of marketing and advertising for companies, specifically those that adhere towards a more creative audience. I find business to be one of my main interests of study, while I also admire mathematics to a degree.<br><br>

        As of Spring 2022, I have primarily focused on my academics opposed to work outside of schooling. Within the course of the past five years, I have maintained a GPA of 3.8 or higher or a steady 4.0. In the past I have also volunteered at multiple venues, such as hospitals and churches as well. I also was involved in numerous clubs at my high school as well, in which were funded by both the students and the school as well. Two major clubs I was involved in were the Anime Club, as well as the Asian Student Union. For both clubs, myself and other club members would gather funds for the events to occur, specifically during holidays or other special occasions. This included Halloween, Christmas, and others as well. The Asian Student Union had become one of the most popular and well known clubs at a school were the percentage of Asian students was fairly smaller compared to other ethnicities. This club was able to bring other Asian and Pacific Islander students together where they feel welcomed and connected on school grounds. The Anime Club was a largely diverse club full of students from all races and ethnicities, coming together to share their interests and make friends whom have those similar interests as well. There were events that occurred similar to the Asian Student Union, but also differed in terms of how it was organized and what occurred in the events. For example, during Halloween, we would have the students dress up as their favorite characters from their favorite franchise, and would have a contest to see who was the best dressed. We would hand out multiple prizes that were all funded by the club members, specifically for first, second, and third place. Every student enjoyed their time at each club, and many students also returned the year after.<br><br>

        As of today, I am now a full time student focusing on my academics. I enjoy organizing and creating new ideas that bring many people together, but as of right now I try my best to focus on school as well as my other priorities. I feel that my experience has helped my growth as a person and for my future as well. Although I enjoyed my experience, I find that focusing on school right now is the most important option for me. Itâ€™s helped me both in regards to personal and social skills, that would definitely help me for future professional endeavors.
